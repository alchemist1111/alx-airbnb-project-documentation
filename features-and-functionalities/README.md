# Airbnb Clone Backend Features and Functionalities

This document provides an overview of the key features and functionalities of the backend for the Airbnb Clone project.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration**: Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts using secure authentication methods like JWT and OAuth (Google, Facebook).
- **User Login and Authentication**: Implement login via email/password and OAuth options for user authentication.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including profile photos, contact information, and preferences.

### 2. Property Listings Management
- **Add Listings**: Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings**: Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering
- **Search Functionality**: Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities.
- **Pagination**: Include pagination for large datasets to avoid performance issues.

### 4. Booking Management
- **Booking Creation**: Guests can book a property for specified dates, with validation to prevent double bookings.
- **Booking Cancellation**: Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on a defined cancellation policy.
- **Booking Status**: Track and update booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

### 5. Payment Integration
- **Payment Gateways**: Integrate secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle upfront payments by guests and automatic payouts to hosts after booking completion.
- **Multi-currency Support**: Provide support for payments in multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they stayed at.
- **Host Responses**: Hosts can respond to reviews left by guests.
- **Linked to Bookings**: Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

### 7. Notifications System
- **Booking Notifications**: Implement email and in-app notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and updates.
- **Payment Notifications**: Notify users about payment updates and transactions.

### 8. Admin Dashboard
- **Admin Controls**: Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing users, listings, bookings, and payments.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management
- **Relational Database**: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for managing the database.
- **Key Tables**: Users (guests and hosts), Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments.

### 2. API Development
- **RESTful APIs**: Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- **GraphQL (Optional)**: Implement GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT Authentication**: Implement JWT for secure user sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Differentiate permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.

### 4. File Storage
- **Cloud Storage**: Use services like AWS S3 or Cloudinary to store property images and user profile photos.

### 5. Third-Party Services
- **Email Notifications**: Use services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
- **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling for APIs.
- **Logging**: Set up logging to track errors and other critical events.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- **Modular Architecture**: Use a modular architecture to ensure the system can scale as traffic increases.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers to manage high traffic.

### 2. Security
- **Data Encryption**: Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
- **Firewalls and Rate Limiting**: Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Use caching solutions like Redis for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- **Database Optimization**: Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

### 4. Testing
- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Implement unit and integration tests for various components.
- **Automated API Testing**: Ensure that all endpoints are tested using automated API testing frameworks like pytest.
